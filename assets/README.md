# Assets Folder

This folder is where you'll upload the personal content for Slyy's love website!

## What to Add:

### Photos 📸
- Upload your photos as **1:1 ratio images** (square format)
- Name them in sequence: `img1.jpg`, `img2.jpg`, `img3.jpg`, etc.
- Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`
- The website will automatically detect and display all images

### Background Music 🎵
- Upload your romantic background music as `song.mp3`
- The music will play automatically when she first interacts with the website
- Mobile-friendly controls will appear if the file exists

### Custom Kiss Image 💋 (Optional)
- If you want a custom kiss animation instead of emoji kisses
- Upload as `kiss.png` (100x100px with transparent background)
- If this file doesn't exist, the website will use cute emoji kisses: 😘, 💋, 💕, 💖, 💗

## Upload Instructions:

1. **Photos**: Add your favorite photos together, rename them to img1.jpg, img2.jpg, etc.
2. **Music**: Add your special song as song.mp3
3. **Custom Kiss**: (Optional) Add a custom kiss image as kiss.png

## Tips:

- Use high-quality, happy photos that show her beautiful smile
- Choose a meaningful song for your background music
- The website works perfectly even without any assets - all features have fallbacks!
- All assets are optional but highly recommended for the full romantic experience

Ready to surprise your amazing Slyy! 💕
